<H1>Emotional Intelligience</H1>
  <H2>What is it?</H2>
  To be able to have knowledge of my own emotions and their impacts as well as those of others. 
  In this way to be able to predict others actions and behave accordingly in order to derive outcomes. 
  Consciously and subconsciously to be able to read and interpret people’s feelings and actions in a way that is not biased, but rather truthful.
  I think EQ demands a certain amount of sensitivity towards others feelings and understanding of their perspective.
  <br>
  <H2>How is it different to IQ?</H2>
  IQ relates to my cognitive ability with regards to things such as analytical or mathematical skills and getting the correct answer as relates to objective truths or matters of raw intelligence. EQ relates to navigating those aspects of work and life that are subjective and are framed by an individual's emotional and historical context. 
  <H2>Why is it important?</H2>
  <p>EQ is important for building teams and engendering trust.</p>
  This adds leverage and momentum to any project and is important for the long term health of a project, community or individual relationship’s success. 
  EQ is valuable because it is a rare quality amongst humans. 
  It adds value both to the subject and object of its influence. 
  People with high EQ are better able to understand other people and are so both happier themselves and more likely to have good boundaries which will allow them to respond to difficult situations with others.
