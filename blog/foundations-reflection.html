<h3>"What surprised me the most about learning core is...".</h3>
  <p>That it was actually useful. I think that I was a bit arrogant to begin with and didn't think any of this touchy feely stuff would really be new or helpful. I do see though that mindfulness, journaling and setting my intentions and reflecting are actually very powerful when used in combination. Also the biggest realisation for me, which I haven't yet put into practise was the idea of visualising what you want to happen and being positive in order to propel that into existence. I think mantras and visualisation (rather than my current moda operandi when feeling overwhelmed: escapism and daydreaming) could be very focussing for my mind and a real shift in consciousness. The other thing that I thought was good was the session I had with the human skills counsellor. Two things stood out: 1) that I will learn better having fun and by feeling safe. When she said the word “safe” it really triggered me and touched something deep inside. Like I really could resonate with how that would be and feel and I wanted that for myself.
2) that I need to hack the areas in my life where I am going to encounter emotional distress, and that’s ok. I don't have to look directly at every single issue and process it so that it’s no longer affecting me. I can just go around, rake another path or trick my brain into not having to face the discomfort. An example is the way I think about “finishing”. I can decide that finishing might be an arbitrary line, rather than the one set for me.. Or if there is a list that is never ending it can be a place in that list that I myself deem a reasonable or appropriate place to end or terminate. Said another way, and this is very important “boundaries are things that I can draw, rather than the outside world or other people deciding them for me”. In the past my parents really did control and not allow me to draw my own boundaries. Still at age 39 they are not able to release their overbearing nature. This combined with a lack of trust and intimacy makes for a very bad situation. In order to have a free life I need to draw the boundaries that I am comfortable with.
  </p>
<h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
  <p>I can draw my own seemingly “arbitrary” boundaries. This applies to both work and my personal(relational) self. Me - I - Myself - I can do this and no one else can say shit about it. Who knew?!
My negativity impacts my work. Being more positive will get me further, faster and so fake it before you make it is going to be the way: I will what I want.
My ego is not my main driver. I am more driven by insecurity. So being safe while learning is paramount for me. This is why I have done well learning alone, free from judgement and other peoples scrutiny. But I want to grow and expand. This means being able to use my confidence to override the insecurity and laugh at myself, knowing that I am not stupid, not lazy and have nothing to loose and much to gain by participating and trying. Public failure is still failure and failure is a necessary process to learning.
  </p>
<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
  <p>Without integrity there can be no trust. In programming as in life without trust we cannot build anything that will be substantive or last. Fluffy but true.
Empathy is important when designing for users, and working in a team.
Self-awareness is kind of a double edged sword. It can be useful but also a hindrance when doing something novel that others may think is “crazy”. You want to be self-aware enough to be able to manoeuvre around interpersonal situations but not so much so that you are self conscious or focussed on what others think (or may think). In programming self awareness probably helps most with regards to communicating and one’s approach to problems and how to solve them. For me I need to not just solve a problem but try and solve it in the least painful way possible.

<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
  <p>Core learning is like exercise: it takes time out of your day that you could be spending on “real work” but taken together, observing the full output of a life as a programmer/person it is value add (even taking into account the time and focus commitment). I like working on myself, that is not surprising as much as just a nice realisation to have.
  </p>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
  <p>Getting myself to do it and not seeing it as merely a box to be checked. Trying to make it applicable to my life whilst being independent minded about what works for me.</p>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
  <p>Transitioning to a growth mindset is difficult. Its not how we have been modelled nor how we have been taught. It takes activation energy and to be reminded of how our brains are always defaulting… in order to rewire them.
Supporting the emotional self whilst challenging the intellectual one is a smart move: less likely to rage quit or exit in too much pain if this is actively managed.
  </p>
<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  <p>I think for me I only took away 3-4 key things but they are really key. It would have been hard to isolate them as they are specific to me, and my context.. Not all students at large.
If I look at my life at large then it was worth spending this time and doing this.
<br>
If I look at my life through the thin vertical of “will I manage at Bootcamp” then probably more time coding would be better.
