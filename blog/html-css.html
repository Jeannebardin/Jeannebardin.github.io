<h2>What is the difference between a Margin, Padding and a Border?</h2> 
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Margin = space outside the element. This is like the thick frame of an artwork. Not an NFT artwork, like an old school one that you hang on the wall bc you're a genuinely cultured person and not just a crypto nerd. It has nothing to do with margin trading.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Padding = space inside the element - this surrounds the contents. This is like the white space in the artwork itself that surround the text which says "You will likely forget this and everything else you will learn at DevAcademy so get good at Googling".</li>
    <br>
    <li>Border: inbetween the Margin and the Padding - surrounding the element. If you don't know what a border is it's that thing that countries have and was magically rediscovered when COVID-19 hit. </li>

 </ul>
  <p>What's an element I hear you say? Well, its pretty much everything in programming and this includes variables, loops, conditionals, input/output, sub-routines and functions.
  I dont know what those things are either.</p>


<h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>

<p>I did some research here. This primarily included other students blogs which I would recommend as a good resource as they are already being filtered through the eyes of a) people smarter than yours truly and b) the instructors.</p>

Here is some ELI5 background first about what a CSS Selectooooooooor is:

When you dress up a website in CSS, it makes sense to have different styling across the elements. Eg you may want to have the word 'Blog' crossed out bc it is repulsive and replaced with 'Journal'.(This is not a blog by the way, it's a DevAcademy assignment and will not see the light of day)

<p>The two selectors you can use would be:
<ul>
  <li>'class' and 'id' </li>
  or, what I remind myself of as:
  <li> . and #</li>
 
</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>The Class selector lets you to create style rules that apply to any element with a class attribute equal to a certain value. It's represented by a full stop or what American's call "a period - ."</p>

<p>The ID selector by contrast is "unique", applying to just one element on the page. Uno solo, or rather #unosolo.</p>

<h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>

<p>CSS Flow Layout was described as "like a congo line" for the elements on a web page. I dont think I can improve on that analogy, so why try.</p>
<p>Static positioning is kind of the default positioning for elements. As we know in game theory defaults are very important.
You could call this static positioning:</p>

<ol>
 <li> css<br>
.static {position: static;}</li>
or just "none"thing at all - which assumes the default (I assume).<li>
<br>
css <br>
.static {/*none!*/}
</ol>

<p>Fixed positioning is when elements are positioned according to the viewer and not the page layout. 
Thus the elements stay in the same place as you scroll down a page. Like one of those horrible Herbalife pop ups on the Dailymail that follows you down the page as you death scroll.</p>

<p>Fixed positions will disappear when out of the view port's vision, but fixed elements will still remain in place.
This is also useful for elements that you don't want to disappear from view regardless of where the user has navigated. 
Examples of this could include navigation, scroll bars and le hamburger.</p>

<p>Relative positioning will move the element as it relates to another/other elements.</p>

<p>Absolute positioning means you have taken an element "out of the congo line" "out of the flow", which then changes the default and current of the other elements.</p>

<p>Diagrams are helpful to understand these concepts, so pls Google them before you go asking me to add into this journal-not-blog.</p>
