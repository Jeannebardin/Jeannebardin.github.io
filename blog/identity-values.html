<div class="Header"> Describe your core personal values.
<br>
</div>
<p class="thick">I value my independence.</p>
<p>I value kindness. I value bravery. I want to value truth.</p>
<p>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</p>

<p>In our community there is the belief that many of the constructs within society, money and the nation state being the most obvious examples, are just this: constructs. That we can reevaluate and change them to suit a new/different context. Marriage is such a construct, and I am married./p></p>

<p>I could have a) had an affair, b) had an open marriage or c) got divorced and then had no constraints from anyone. But I have children and ethically I believe in what I said “till death do us part”. I loved this person enough then to say that, and promise that. To me what being ethical is is to be truthful to yourself and others. To do what you say, if it is at all within your control. So I will say no, to other opportunities and relational ways to avoid feeling overwhelmed, triggered by things that bring up my childhood/family and my innate desire to be independent and not have to trust. I will stay married, to my best friend whom I have known since I was 18 (20+ years). </p>

<p>The things I weighed up were related to long term outcomes. When I look at this there is no question on where happiness will compound - my marriage. The immediate consequences of this action are that I needed to create space. This meant cutting certain people out and creating boundaries, and being accountable. It meant coming to NZ, and doing a coding course which will take my focus, improve my confidence, and give me time to spend with my family as well as have my husband's full attention. So the short term consequences are tldr; pain. But the long term consequences are good - as long as I keep making progress in the right direction and am honest with myself. It's hard to do - I’m such a talented liar.</p>

<p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
<p>My family are very conservative - both religiously and politically. They grew up in an oppressed society in Apartheid era South Africa. I reject many of their values, whilst simultaneously manifesting others as my own. Maybe this in some ways could make me self loathing without even being aware of it.</p>

<p>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</p>
<p>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>

<p>My strengths are that I am experienced. I have taught myself many difficult things including crypto and Mandarin chinese. My limitations have to do with my confidence and inability to give up when I need to and pivot. I am better at this after a failed startup but still far too much on the scale of punishment and not enough on that which is “this too shall pass” and “its all small fry”. I dont like to ask for help when I can look stupid - so strangers are fine, friends are more difficult.. Especially male friends.</p>
<p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
It helps to be disciplined. At the moment I have the attention span of a 13 year old boy - but I am saved by my ability to plan and be disciplined, organised and incremental.

<p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
<p>I was trying to make sure the Web3 hack had a good reputation and good speakers. So I said only I could choose who they were. This seemed authoritarian. Which it is. I think I prioritised quality over community bc I thought it would reflect on me if things were lame. But the truth is community is lame, and people have different taste levels. What I do will be good and what others do will be mediocre. But that is also the point of community - to have it! Not for me to do it for everyone. My strategies were just to give examples of how good I was, and why I deserved the platform and leadership role (also bc no one else wanted to do it, nor the heavy lifting).</p>

<p>For me the best strategies are always to do things in person not via text, to be collaborative and listen, even and especially when I disagree. </p>
