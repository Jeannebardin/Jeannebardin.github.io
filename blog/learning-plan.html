<h3><General</h3>
<p>I will try and exercise (including walking) every day. This has not started well, but we are only in week 3 and so there is time to add this into the routine.</p>
<p>On days when I have had no/little sleep I will try and catch up with 90 mins.</p>

<p>I will try and set my goals for every day, AFTER I have reflected on my progress (or lack thereof) from the previous day. I will set ambitious goals but be forgiving of myself when I do not achieve them.</p>

<p>To avoid distractions I will write notes of thoughts and add to my admin todo list but not open messaging apps/comms or execute these unless in a block of time at the end of a learning session.</p>

<p>I will be mindful of my physical posture. </p>

<p>I will try to be proud of who I am and how God made me, rather than apologetic.</p>

<h3>Plan for Foundations:</h3>
<p>9-5pm and evenings (1hr min). As much or as little as I can manage according to a) how much work there is and b) what other interests/commitments/life challenges I have eg. kids, marriage, health and moving countries.</p>

<h3>Plan for Bootcamp:</h3>
<p>8-6pm and evenings (1hr min). Weekends only evenings.</p>

<p>I will allow myself coffee and lunch break, as well as to walk the dog and take 5 minute breaks in the sunshine and for tea. I will not schedule these as I prefer spontaneity and may have a varying schedule, but I will not cheat myself either by being lazy or allowing procrastination. Rather I will go with the flow: working hard and making iterative progress. JUST STARTING! Being encouraging of myself and not getting frustrated. Look how well I did at the Chain Flip validator! I will remind myself of this technical achievement every day as fuel for the fire.</p>



---------

<p>I think I can manage my workload, achieve my goals and be a valuable member of the Dev academy community, as long as I set good boundaries and focus on incrementalism.</p>

<p>I will try to articulate when I feel overwhelmed: not to alarm anyone but to get support and try and avoid hiding in the shame of procrastination or self doubt.</p>

<p>I will seek help when I get stuck, but I will also help myself through reasonable attempts at googling and research.</p>

<p>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</p>
<p>To support me in my goals to learn and challenge myself. Help me to navigate the path technically and where applicable provide advice regarding “humps” that I may encounter along the journey (see below).</p>

<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>I would like to develop a network that I can use to continue to educate myself and others (including my children). These friendships will make work fun and give it meaning. This includes people in crypto but also at DevAcademy. I don't know how much longer I will be alive, so I want to make sure every day counts. I know myself: I am happy when I am learning and in community. As a leader I have the opportunity to shape my community. This may include developing educational resources or working in an area that leverages my network and knowledge.</p>

<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
<p>My strengths are that I am a lateral thinker, and am always prepared to start at zero again and humiliate myself. In the past I was very competitive and could harness this trait to motivate and drive myself. I am very disciplined. </p>
<p>My limitations may be around self doubt, criticism and distraction. Its hard to be objective about one's own shortcomings because they are usually blind spots: else they would have been fixed already.</p>

<h3>Meta-Challenges:</h3>
<p>The biggest “hump” I have at the moment is a growing realisation that I have some OCD. Its very subtle and probably is not something that would need to be attended to unless I was under pressure (e.g. in this learning environment). The issue I have has been with me since I was a child and is a compulsion to be able to keep my learning and work “under control”. It manifests as work-a-holism, being unable to keep unread books in my house (they taunt me with their undigested knowledge) and the constant feeling that I am failing and don't have enough time. I still have the occasional nightmare about getting behind on maths class in school, or not doing my homework.. which seems altogether ridiculous at age 39. </p>
<p>I also struggle not to do things sequentially, and to not finish things. I want to do things end-to-end because I feel like this is lazy or whatever. But many things should be given up, retired or put to bed. They are not possible with children, or indeed modern life. The fact that I can still speak Mandarin and Italian ten years after having studied them shows you how much I am willing to punish myself in order not to lose my edge. I’m proud of these achievements but they cost me a lot of happiness - I always feel like I am not doing enough and scared to undertake new skills or challenges because of the burden of continuing them. My all or nothing somewhat obsessive nature isn't very forgiving on a human with only 24 hours in the day.</p>

<p>I want my learning to be carefree, not just another way to self flagellate and punish myself. I feel that my OCD is very harsh with me, as my eating disorder used to be. It doesn't allow for grace and is not congruent with a growth mentality and mindset.</p>
I hope that I can work on this during my time at Dev Academy, but I don't really know what the solution is. I guess you just have to practise letting go until it becomes a habit.

<h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
I need to work on team work and being collaborative. This will be difficult to learn here as there is nothing at stake - the exercises are a simulation only. But maybe we can work on something that is public and useful to my current work in which case I will want to take ownership and assume a taste level. Then it will be a real challenge and a way to grow in this area.

<p>My husband said said something interesting to me when he read this, which was that he thinks I am a collaborative person in general, but where I tend not to be when I am working on a project that has some idealistic trait that challenges (or represents my identity).. And usually one that I feel is a rejection of my parents and their mostly conservative values. In those cases my identity is trumping everything and I tend to be very dogmatic and binary, unwilling to compromise and sure of how I see things. As a founder I probably still have too much of my identity wrapped up in my work, and as someone in crypto my personal philosophy drives a lot of my decisions and choices regarding with whom and how I spend my time and capital.</p>
