<h2>.map</h2>


Array.map() is a succinct method to achieve the outcome of iterating over an array using a loop. This allows you to modify an array’s elements using a callback function. The callback function will then be executed on each of the array's elements.

Here is an array:

Let exampleArray = [7, 8, 9, 10]

Lets times (*) these by 10.


for (let i = 0; i < exampleArray.length; i++){
  exampleArray[i] = exampleArray[i] * 10;
}

return(exampleArray); // [70, 80, 90, 100]


We can do the same thing as above and use a different JS ‘method’. Methods are like shortcuts that make things more succinct as they are preprogrammed to work.

let exampleArray = [7, 8, 9, 10];

let modifiedArr = exampleArray.map(function(element){
    return element *10;
});

return(modifiedArr); // [70, 80, 90, 100]

<h2>.parseInt</h2>

This is a function in JS that “parses” or “breaks down” a string and then returns an integer (number) or a NaN (Not a Number). It extracts it. 

To remember Nan: think of the fact that your Nanna in an old age home is Not just a number she is a human being!

<h2>Examples:</h2>

parseInt(string)

const someorothernumber = '99';
console.log(77 + someorothernumber);
// returns 7799

The reason is because in this example ‘99’ is in inverted commas, i.e it is a string.

const  someorothernumber = '100';
console.log(2 + parseInt(someorothernumber));
// returns 102

Basically this is saying “make my number an integer”
In contrast to this - when would we get a NaN value returned?

This would happen if we have text to begin a string. Eg like "This is her big birthday and she is 3!" will return a NaN value because the parseInt function considers only the FIRST value starting the string. If the value is not a number then it will read as NOT A NUMBER and return NaN.
