Neuroplasticity Research 

Q: How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people? 
A: Self awareness seems to make us more effective. Imagination is 40% as effective as doing.

Q: How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?
For myself I think that developing positivity and especially a positive personal narrative are areas where I can grow. I tend to be very severe and harsh with myself. Perfectionism is something I have struggled with and whilst this sounds arrogant it's not meant in the sense people would usually imagine. To me it means I get a fail at anything less that a perfect outcome. Rather than attempting to make sure I get the big things in life 85% right I will kill myself and overstretch to be able to get 100% (and also fail in other/adjecent vertices.. Like relationships or health).

I realise that positivity is a habit. If I am going to be a more positive person I will also be more successful as it is a self fulfilling prophecy in some senses. Positivity inspires action, bravery and courage to take on new things! Being positive is a choice: to reframe my situation in a way that is kind and forgiving to myself and will allow a score under 100 or “perfect”. 85% is good enough in most things. If I keep doing this my brain will change and I will feel less like being positive is an effort and more like it is my default state of thinking. I need to make sure that I realise disappointments are not personal, things are rarely permanent and that just because one thing might be screwed up or fail it is not pervasive and I Jeanne am not a failure, it's just a thing I do to get from a to b and back up again.

There is much power in positive thinking and visualisation. Conscious planning, or planning in my subconscious. I need to make time to imagine these things.
For instance instead of imagining that I am younger and flawless, I can imagine that I am my age, ageing gracefully and that I have supreme confidence.. This can be achieved and will actually in an ironic way make me appear younger.


Q: What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
Challenge oneself and learn new things like languages!
Train your brain to be able to be consistent in the habits that you want to inculcate.
Be mindful of your own thoughts and bosses and “take every thought captive” as necessary
Believe that it is possible to change! To evolve, and to forgive.


Q: What is Growth Mindset and why it is relevant?

A: It's the idea that we are “not yet done” - rather than to have failed in the first instance. An iterative approach to learning that accepts struggle, hardship and being uncomfortable as not just a necessary part but a positive experience on the way to personal growth

Q: In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
I guess that my negative self talk was not just affecting the way I felt, but also the way I got stuff done and the pleasure and ease with which I could go about my business.

Q: How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

A: I think when bootcamp starts (or probably even now) I need to practise visualisation and mantras for myself. To really embody these desires.
