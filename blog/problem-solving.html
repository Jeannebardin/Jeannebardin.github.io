<h3>Problem Solving</h3>


<p>It’s actually difficult for me to think of problems that I have solved, because my mind jumps immediately to problems that still need my attention. When I was setting up my first validator I had to SSH into a remote server.. This means I needed to use someone else’s computer space but control it from my laptop. I misunderstood how this SSH business works and tried to both control and setup the validator on my laptop, causing myself a lot of confusion and wasting a lot of time. The way that I solved the problem was to ask for help (waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late) and then to draw out the architecture of what I was building. In fact this was how the issue was discovered: I drew it out and someone noticed that my data was located in the wrong box and diagrammatically represented on my laptop, not the server. After I realised where this conceptual fault was I could replan and execute the validator rather simply. From now on when I do a setup for something like this I will sketch the architecture first. The problems solving techniques I used initially did not work: googling, reading and rereading the documents, taking breaks and trying many different things (and downloading many too!). Asking for help did work, but I needed to ask the right person and give him the context, which demanded his focussed attention and time. Through the process I felt incredibly frustrated, alone and couldnt work out why I was having issues. I know that I am smart and able to follow instructions… but in this case I had skipped a few rather than being careful about doing things sequentially. I also learnt this lesson: everything must be done in order and you can’t come back to something and move on because you are frustrated: it’s better to take a break.
I learnt very valuable lessons: firstly what SSH is and how to do it! Secondly to ask for help early, but not immediately. Thirdly that it's inevitable that I will look stupid and make mistakes while I learn the foundations. This is partly why I am doing this bootcamp: to find a safe place to do so. Lastly to draw or quickly sketching things up will often prevent mistakes and provide clarity especially when working in a team.
I think my biggest learning was not actually about problem solving though, it was that I have some learned helplessness with regards to technical challenges. I asked to “get a new account” so that I could start from the beginning when I ran into difficulty. The idea that I was capable of fixing it seemed just too hard to me. But they refused and so I had to try and I was able to fix it. The way that I feel I should be able to fix this problem is not to see these things as life or death events. They are just problems and if they are not able to be fixed everyone will live another day, actually many more days. I need to put myself under much much less pressure and expect to fail, rather than grading anything under 100% as a fail.

<h2>When have I elegantly solved a problem?</h2>
<p>In the last most of the problems I have solved have been via people and via hacks. I’m not sure of hacks count as elegant. To me they are clever ways to solve things, rather than the traditional or obvious means..
I think doing this course was solving a problem that I have: which is my own confidence around technical language and understanding. I don't have time as a mom to dedicate myself to it full time for the long term but I found this course and made it happen to get myself and my family to NZ because I recognise that although administratively it is challenging, the payoff is great: max return on time invested. 
The problem was that I felt ashamed to ask technical questions and insecure about my abilities in an industry of (often) autistic young men. I was struggling to grow on my own because as a mom I didn't have enough time to focus. I used the following techniques:
Googling and doing research on the course
Asking an expert (spoke to former student and a teacher at the school)
Repetition (applied twice)
I tried something (i.e running the validator to prepare and so tested my hypothesis that I could code and would enjoy it)
Through the process I felt anxious because I didn't know if my husband would agree and if I would fail and let the team down. Byu fail I mean “fail to reach my potential: they mythical state that has never been attained, haha)
I learnt that God’s timing is perfect, and that people are what make other people successful. You can only do so much on your own. I will succeed at Dev Academy bc of the other students and Instructors and counsellors, not just my own effort.

<h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
<p>

</p>
  <ul>
<li>Pseudocode: I like this - it’s like taking notes and makes me feel in control</li>
<li>Trying something - I don't mind trying but I dislike trying many times as I get frustrated with myself and am harsh</li>
Rubber ducky method - I need to do this: I just feel silly!
Reading error messages - I am getting better at this, sometimes I find them hard to understand
Console.logging - similarly I realise there is power in the console log and as Johnny says it “never gets old”
Googling - I am improving. Helps to now know language + what you want to do
Asking your peers for help - I feel less embarrassed as they seem to be nice
Asking coaches for help - this is the easiest way to make progress
Improving your process with reflection - I see more and more value to doing this, and so am doing it more and more…
  </ul>
